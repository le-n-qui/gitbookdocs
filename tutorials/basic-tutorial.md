# Basic Tutorial: Part 1

## Description

This tutorial is intended for those who have never used Xena before. We will cover how to create your first Visual Spreadsheet \(link\) with gene expression, mutation, and copy number variation data.

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes a basic understanding of 

* cancer processes that can lead to altered gene expression, such as copy number variation or mutation
* values in gene expression, mutation, and copy number variation data
* The Cancer Genome Atlas \(TCGA\)

## Estimated time needed

**Part A**: 5 min

**Part B**: 10 min

## Learning goals

### Part A

* Create a Visual Spreadsheet
* Compare data across columns

### Part B

* Move columns
* Resize columns
* Zoom in and out

## Tutorial

### Biological Background

We are going to be examining EGFR aberrations in lung adenocarcinomas using TCGA. We will be looking at mutation and copy number aberrations and how they affect gene expression.

### Part A

Our goal is to build a Visual Spreadsheet and understand the relationship between the columns

#### Steps

1. Start at our home page [http://xena.ucsc.edu/](http://xena.ucsc.edu/) and click on 'Launch Xena'. You are now in our Visual Spreadsheet Wizard.
2. Type 'GDC TCGA Lung Adenocarcinoma', select this study from the drop down menu, and click 'Done'
3. Type 'EGFR', select the checkboxes for Gene Expression, Copy Number, and Somatic Mutation, and click 'Done'

#### How to read a Visual Spreadsheet

{% endhint %}

### Part B

To further explore the relationship between the gene expression, mutation, and copy number variation data for EGFR, we will move columns to change the sort order, resize columns, and zoom in both for the entire Visual Spreadsheet and within a column.

#### Steps

1. **Move columns.** Click on column ... and drag it to the left so that it becomes the first column after the samples column \(i.e. column B\). Note that the samples are now sorted by the values in this column
2. **Resize columns.** Click on the handle in the lower right corner of column ... Move it to the right to make the column bigger. 
3. **Zoom in on a column.**
4. **Zoom out on a column.**
5. **Zoom in on samples.** We will aim to look more closely at samples with ... Click and drag vertically in any column in the Visual Spreadsheet to zoom in on these samples
6. **Zoom out on samples.** To zoom out click either 'Zoom out' or 'Clear zoom' at the top of the Visual Spreadsheet.
