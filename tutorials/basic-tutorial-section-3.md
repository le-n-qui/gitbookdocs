# Basic Tutorial: Section 3

## Description

This tutorial is intended for those who have never used Xena before but who have completed Section 1 of the Basic Tutorial \(completion of Section 2 is recommended but not required\). We will cover how to make box plots and bar charts using our Charts and Statistics View and how to add another column of data, in particular phenotype data, to the view.

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes completion of the [Basic Tutorial: Section 1](basic-tutorial-section-1.md). Completion of [Basic Tutorial: Section 2](basic-tutorial-section-2.md) is recommended but not required. This tutorial begins where the Basic Tutorial: Section 2 ends. A live link to the end of Basic Tutorial: Section 2 is provided at the beginning of this tutorial.

## Estimated time needed

**Part A**: 5 min

**Part B**: 15 min

## Learning goals

### Part A

* Create a box plot and violin plot using the Charts and Statistics View

### Part B

* Add another column of data to the view
* Add phenotype data to the view
* Create a bar chart using the Charts and Statistics View

## Tutorial

In the Basic Tutorial: Section 1 we found that we found that samples that have aberrations in _EGFR_ \(mutations or amplifications\) have higher expression.

In the Basic Tutorial: Section 2 we created two subgroups: those with aberrations and those without aberrations in _EGFR_. We ran a Kaplan Meier survival analysis and found that there was no survival difference between these two groups. 

Now we are going to use the subgroups created in the Basic Tutorial: Section 2 to see if there is a statistical difference in expression between the two subgroups and whether males or females have more aberrations.

### Part A

We found that samples that have aberrations in _EGFR_ \(mutations or amplifications\) have higher expression. Now we are going to investigate if this difference in expression statistically significant.

### Part B

We will now investigate how _EGFR_ aberrations compare between men and women.
