## Request a workshop

Workshops are a great way to teach a group of people how to use Xena. They can be 1-hour, 1/2-day, or 1-day in length. While we find that inn person workshops are the most effective, they can also be given remotely via Webex or a similar technology. We give workshops both within the USA and internationally.
