Welcome to Xena. Below is an overview of what Xena is followed by a few tutorials. 

We recommend starting with the [Basic Tutorial Sections](basic-tutorial-section-1.md) listed in the left panel.

If you have a specific question, check out our ['How do I ...' Guides](../how-do-i/).

## Request a workshop

Workshops are a great way to teach a group of people how to use Xena. They can be 1-hour, 1/2-day, or 1-day in length. While we find that inn person workshops are the most effective, they can also be given remotely via Webex or a similar technology. We give workshops both within the USA and internationally.
