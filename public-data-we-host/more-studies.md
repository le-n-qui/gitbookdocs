## [UCSC RNA-seq recompute compendium](https://toil.xenahubs.net/) 

TCGA, TARGET and GTEx RNA-seq data are uniformly re-aligned to hg38 genome, and re-processed using RSEM and Kallisto methods with gencode v23 annotations to generate expression estimates for ~60,000 genes and ~200,000 transcripts, including many LncRNAs. Xena hosts and displays gene and transcript expression results of this analysis.

## [ICGC](https://icgc.xenahubs.net/) 

International Cancer Genome Consortium \(ICGC\) goal is to obtain a comprehensive description of genomic, transcriptomic and epigenomic changes in 50 different tumor types and/or subtypes which are of clinical and societal importance across the globe. It includes TCGA data \(U.S.A.\) plus data contributed by groups from other countries in the International Cancer Genome Consortium. The resource has publically-accessible non-coding somatic mutation data from non-TCGA samples.
