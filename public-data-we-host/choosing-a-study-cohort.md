| lncRNA expression | TCGA Pan-Cancer \(PANCAN\) | TOIL Gene expression | Advanced |
| Exon expression | legacy TCGA datasets \(per cancer type\) | Exon expression | Advanced |
| miRNA expression | TCGA Pan-Cancer \(PANCAN\) | Batch Effects normalized miRNA data | Advanced |
| DNA methylation | Any | DNA methylation | Advanced |
| ATAC-seq | GDC Pan-Cancer \(PANCAN\) | ATAC-seq | Advanced |
| Varied Survival endpoints | TCGA Pan-Cancer \(PANCAN\) | NA \(run KM plot\) | -- |
