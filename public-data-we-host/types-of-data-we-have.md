# Types of data we have

We support a wide variety of data types including:

* SNPs and small INDELs
* Large structural variants
* Segmented copy number, gene-level copy number
* Gene-, Transcript-, Exon-, Protein-, LncRNA-, and miRNA-expression
* DNA methylation \(genes and probes\)
* Phenotype, clinical data
* Signature scores, classifications, derived parameters

The type of data in each study vary considerably and depend on what analyses that particular study performed

If you need a particular type of data, please see [choosing a study/cohort](choosing-a-study-cohort.md) to help you find the study with that type of data
