# How do I view my data with the data from TCGA?

## Adding in new samples

We don't provide a simple way to do this because of the batch effects that would be present when combining most data across studies. You will need to download the data you wish to combine from TCGA, combine it yourself either in Microsoft Excel or some other program, and then load it into your own Xena hub.

You can download the TCGA data through our data pages: [https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/](https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/)

[Here is more information about our data file formats](../local-xena-hub/data-format-specifications.md).

## Adding in more data on the TCGA samples, such as new subtype calls

Load your data into your own Xena hub and select the cohort that you want to view your data side-by-side with. Note that you will need to match the sample names to those that are already in Xena.

[More information about the sample names can be found for each dataset.](https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/)

Note that if you want to view a genomic signature on our gene expression data, you can do so using our [genomic signature feature.](../overview-of-features/genomic-signatures.md)
